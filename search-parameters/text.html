  	<h2>Search Parameters In Javascript and HTML</h2>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Search parameters are a way to get information from different elements. 
	In this lesson I will be showing you how to use search parameters for URLs. </p>
	<h3>Url Search Parameters </h3>
	<p>First, we need to create a variable with the value set to make a new object type that uses the URLSearchParams object.</p>

	<p>Now we need to define what we are searching for in the query string. 
	In this case we are searching for a value in the URL, so we need to use the location element with the search method to get the query string in the URL.</p>

	<p>And finally, we need a way to get the query string.</p>
	<p>To get the query string, we need to make a new variable with the value set to the parameter variable with the string "get" method, and define what part of the query to set it to.</p>

	<p>This code makes it so the "value" variable is set to the value after "?value=" in the url. </p>
	<p>For example, if you put "?value=example" at the end of the url, the "value" variable would be set to "example".</p>
