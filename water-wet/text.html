<h2>Is water wet?</h2>
<h3>No, here is why:</h3>
<br>
<p>The definition of “wet” can be:</p>
<p>     1. An adjective: covered or saturated with water or another liquid.</p>
<p>     2. A verb: cover or touch with liquid; moisten.</p>
<p>     3. A noun: liquid that makes something damp.</p>
<br>
<p>With “wet” as an adjective, if you have one water molecule, it is not covered or saturated with water or another liquid because IT is the liquid that makes something wet, so one water molecule not touching another water molecule is not wet since one molecule of water is one hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms (H2O).</p>
<br>
<p>Some  people may argue for the noun proving water is wet, they are wrong; the context in which “wet” as a noun is used refers to the attribute of a liquid, for example: "I could feel the wet of his tears" or “I could feel the muscles of his arms”.</p>
