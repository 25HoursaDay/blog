<h2>Bookmarklets</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A bookmarklet is an executable script that can be ran through the browser's bookmark system.</p>
<p>The way this works is you make a piece of javascript code into a url by adding "javascript:" or "javascript://" before it, and prefferably ASCII encoding it.</p>
