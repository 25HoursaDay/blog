<h2>Bookmarklets</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A JavaScript bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code that is saved as a bookmark in a web browser. When the bookmark is clicked, the JavaScript code is executed, allowing the user to interact with the current webpage in some way.

Bookmarklets are often used to add functionality to a webpage, such as the ability to highlight text or translate the page into a different language. They can also be used for more advanced tasks, such as performing web scraping or manipulating the HTML and CSS of the page.

To create a JavaScript bookmarklet, you first need to write the JavaScript code that you want to execute. This code should be wrapped in a function, and the function should be called when the bookmark is clicked. Once you have written the code, you can create a bookmark in your web browser and paste the JavaScript code into the bookmark's URL or location field.

When you click the bookmark, the JavaScript code will be executed, and you will see the results of the code on the webpage. You can also create bookmarklets that prompt the user for input or that display a dialog box, allowing you to create more interactive bookmarklets.

Bookmarklets are useful because they allow you to add custom functionality to a webpage without having to install a browser extension or plugin. They are also portable, as you can save a bookmarklet and use it on any computer that has a web browser. However, bookmarklets are limited in the functionality they can provide, as they do not have access to the browser's APIs or other resources that are available to extensions and plugins.
