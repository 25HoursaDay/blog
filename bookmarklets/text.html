<h2>Bookmarklets</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A bookmarklet is an executable script that can be ran through the browser's bookmark system.</p>
<p>The way this works is you make a piece of javascript code into a urn/url by adding "javascript:" or "javascript://" before it, and prefferably ASCII encoding it.</p>
<p>I found a wonderful resource for making bookmarklets, click <a href="https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/">here</a> to use it.</p>
<p> And <a href="">here</a> is a good example of a bookmarklet made by a friend.</p>
